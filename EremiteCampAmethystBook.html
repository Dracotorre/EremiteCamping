<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/M_letter.png'>apping helps you locate your campsites using your journal and map. Each camp may be associated with a gem to help with identification. This book guides you on mapping the Eremite Amethyst Camp.

Begin by entering a tent or sit on the bed-roll. Read this book to map the tent. The Eremite Amethyst Camp appears in Miscallaneous quests. Toggle to show or hide on your map. You may freely reposition your tent, and the map marker will remain at original location. Read this book again to remove the quest from your journal and clear the marker.
